# Data Analysis Projects for Data Science

This repository contains various data analysis projects for data science, with a focus on different machine learning techniques, including PCA, SVM, and more. The projects are organized into different folders, each representing a unique project or learning module.

## Folder Structure

This repository contains the following folders:

1. **PCA_mtcars_data_project**
2. **Principle Component Analysis_Anvari**
3. **final_project**
4. **learn_all_chapter**
5. **svm (support vector machine)**

Each folder contains one or more data analysis projects that aim to explore and implement different data science concepts.

## Project Descriptions

You can find detailed descriptions and instructions for each folder below:

### 1. **PCA_mtcars_data_project**

This folder contains a project that uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the `mtcars` dataset. The aim is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much information as possible. The project involves data preprocessing, applying PCA, and interpreting the results.

### 2. **Principle Component Analysis_Anvari**

This project focuses on applying **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to a custom dataset called **Anvari**. PCA is used to identify the most significant features, reduce dimensionality, and visualize the transformed data.

### 3. **final_project**

# Wine Quality Data Analysis

This repository contains an R-based analysis of the wine quality dataset (`RW.xlsx`). The analysis includes techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, and visualization to explore and model the relationship between wine quality and its various features.

## Description

This R script performs data analysis using several techniques to understand the wine quality dataset and visualize the results. The key tasks include:

- Reading the data from an Excel file.
- Calculating a correlation matrix.
- Performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (Exploratory).
- Conducting linear regression to predict wine quality based on principal component scores.
- Removing outliers using Mahalanobis distance.
- Visualizing the results using biplots, factor loadings plots, and correlation plots.



### 4. **learn_all_chapter**

This folder contains educational content for learning different chapters of data science techniques. It includes examples and exercises from multiple domains, such as **data preprocessing**, **model evaluation**, and **machine learning algorithms** like decision trees, regression, clustering, and more.

### 5. **svm (support vector machine)**

This folder contains a project that applies the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm to a dataset. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The project explores the mathematical foundations of SVM and implements it on real-world data to classify it into different categories.
