# Data Analysis Projects for Data Science

This repository contains various data analysis projects for data science, with a focus on different machine learning techniques, including PCA, SVM, and more. The projects are organized into different folders, each representing a unique project or learning module.

## Folder Structure

This repository contains the following folders:

1. **PCA_mtcars_data_project**
2. **Principle Component Analysis_Anvari**
3. **final_project**
4. **learn_all_chapter**
5. **svm (support vector machine)**

Each folder contains one or more data analysis projects that aim to explore and implement different data science concepts.

## Project Descriptions

You can find detailed descriptions and instructions for each folder below:

### 1. **PCA_mtcars_data_project**

This folder contains a project that uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the `mtcars` dataset. The aim is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much information as possible. The project involves data preprocessing, applying PCA, and interpreting the results.

### 2. **Principle Component Analysis_Anvari**

This project focuses on applying **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to a custom dataset called **Anvari**. PCA is used to identify the most significant features, reduce dimensionality, and visualize the transformed data.

### 3. **final_project**

This folder contains the final project that ties together various data analysis techniques. It may include multiple steps of data wrangling, model building, and evaluation. The project uses advanced machine learning algorithms, and the objective is to produce accurate predictions and insights.

### 4. **learn_all_chapter**

This folder contains educational content for learning different chapters of data science techniques. It includes examples and exercises from multiple domains, such as **data preprocessing**, **model evaluation**, and **machine learning algorithms** like decision trees, regression, clustering, and more.

### 5. **svm (support vector machine)**

This folder contains a project that applies the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm to a dataset. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The project explores the mathematical foundations of SVM and implements it on real-world data to classify it into different categories.
